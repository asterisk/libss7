	* libss7 1.0.1 released

2008-08-05 22:28 +0000 [r201-202]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* /, LICENSE (added): add LICENSE file

	* Makefile, ss7.c, ss7test.c, ss7_internal.h, isup.c, mtp2.c,
	  parser_debug.c, ss7_sched.c, mtp3.c, isup.h, mtp2.h, libss7.h,
	  mtp3.h, ss7linktest.c: clean up license headers explicitly grant

	  ss7test and ss7linktest when DAHDI is found, not Zaptel stop
	  using DAHDI typedefs that no longer exist

2008-07-30 15:42 +0000 [r200]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* Makefile, mkdep (removed), /: use new version and dependency
	  stuff here too

2008-07-29 22:48 +0000 [r199]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* build_tools/make_version: I believe this is what was meant. (it
	  matches how Asterisk does it)

2008-07-19 16:08 +0000 [r198]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* mtp2.c: Fix potential bug in which we might have lost the last
	  MSU received, but we never checked the new FSN in the following
	  FISUs which would cause us not to request retransmission of the
	  lost MSU and potentially cause the remote end's T7 (message
	  acknowledgement timer) to expire and reset the link

2008-07-18 14:58 +0000 [r197]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* isup.c: Make sure we're populating the correct event types in FAA
	  and CGB

2008-07-16 15:49 +0000 [r196]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* ss7test.c: Fix ss7test.c to use new TRANSPORT definitions
	  (#13075)

2008-07-11 21:30 Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* Libss7 1.0.0 released!

2008-07-11 21:30 +0000 [r185-186]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* parser_debug.c, ss7linktest.c: Make linktest program work with
	  new transport definitions

	* ss7.c, libss7.h: Remove DAHDI dependency from libss7

2008-06-29 01:56 +0000 [r184]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* ss7.c, ss7test.c, ss7linktest.c: Make libss7 compatible with
	  DAHDI. No more Zaptel (get 0.9.1 branch if you need Zaptel
	  support, although it is not going to be maintained)

2008-06-28 14:37 +0000 [r183]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* ss7.c: remove unnecessary include of zaptel.h

2008-06-27 19:06 +0000 [r181]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* libss7.h: Add work around for new DAHDI name

2008-06-21 02:40 +0000 [r178-180]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* ss7.c: Put zaptel header back in

	* ss7.c, isup.c: Try to make the isup_find_call and __isup_new_call
	  logic in isup_receive less prone to instability caused by people
	  making mistakes when writing code for new events and messages.
	  This will make the default behavior to generate a new, unlinked
	  call for scratchpad purposes by default. There is much less
	  potential of free'ing an active call if we make the switch's
	  default to do this instead of having the default finding an
	  existing call

	* isup.c: Make sure we don't lose our old call if CFN comes in

2008-06-14 21:11 +0000 [r177]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* ss7.c, isup.c: Fix bug which occurred when messages are received
	  but no events were output. We were allocating a new event by
	  default, which sometimes would contain an old event. If we did
	  not fill in the newly allocated event, a duplicate of the
	  previous event was given to the user application, which sometimes
	  could cause a crash from an already free'd call being handed
	  back.

2008-05-30 19:32 +0000 [r173-176]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	  announcments I have made on the Asterisk-ss7 mailing list as well
	  as update the README

	* isup.c: Don't need to output hex since we get it in the next line
	  (for message type)

	  print message type and CIC before erroring out of ISUP dump

2008-05-28 14:46 +0000 [r172]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* isup.c: jip_transmit is a FUNC_SEND, not FUNC_RECV. Also, since
	  jip_number is a static field, we shouldn't have to check for it's
	  existance before we check to see if something is there

2008-05-16 19:52 +0000 [r169-171]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* isup.c: Report CIC number when debug message appears

	* mtp2.c: Add the write flag in a couple of more places that might
	  need it. Basically, it needs to be set any time any MTP2
	  parameter changes (bib, fib, fsn, bsn)

	* mtp2.c: Need to update write flag everytime we receive a valid
	  MSU since FISU's BSN needs to be updated

2008-05-10 00:59 +0000 [r160-161]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* ss7.c, mtp2.c, mtp2.h, libss7.h, ss7linktest.c: Add support for
	  kernel MTP2 support
